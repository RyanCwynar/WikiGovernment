# WikiGovernment
A crowdsourced legal code that could be used to run a country with very little bureaucratic overhead. Become a Citizen-Stakeholder and contribute!

## Abstract

Changes in the modern world have resulted in extremely sophisticated communication tools such that many people from many places can collaborate to produce incredible works of code, art, and thought. These advances are exemplified by the open source movement.

These tools may have advanced so much, in fact, that entirely new forms of government are possible which can avoid the pitfalls of historical structures.

The concept being proposed here is not a form of representative government or direct/indirect democracy, but instead what is being explored here is more accurately described as "direct legislature" -- the crafting and implentation of laws by the citizen stakeholders themselves.

## Advantages
Very low:
 - management costs
 - waste
 - corruption
 
If such a system could be achieved, it is very likely that it would incredibly low levels of management cost (taxes), wastes (funds ineptly allocated, but with good intentions), and corruption (funds intentionally allocated with bad intentions) relative to the current systems.

Furthermore, recent advances in cryptocurrency and smart contracts make it so that the transfer and allocation of public funds could largely be executed in a way that was transparent and automatic. This capability has never before existed in human history. 

## All Welcome
This project is a thought experiment to see what would happen if many people could pool their thought together effectively to govern themselves in a theoretical country in a way that would achieve the outcomes stated above -- lower management costs, waste, and corruption that any other governmental system.

## Practical Application
Eventually a project like this could grow to the point where it could live along side the current government and be used as a measuring tool to compare the performance of legislators with their adherence to the will of the people and best/agreed upon solutions that were arrived at without the alarmism and distraction of election politics.
