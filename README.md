# WikiGovernment
A crowdsourced legal code that could be used to run a country with very little bureaucratic overhead.

## Abstract

Changes in the modern world have resulted in extremely sophisticated communication tools such that many people from many places can collaborate to produce incredible works of code, art, and thought. These advances are exemplified by the open source movement.

These tools may have advanced so much, in fact, that entirely new forms of government are possible which can avoid the pitfalls of historical structures.

The concept being proposed here is not a form of representative government or direct/indirect democracy, but instead what is being explored here is more accurately described as "direct legislature" -- the crafting and implentation of laws by the citizen stakeholders themselves.

## Advantages
Very low:
 - management costs
 - waste
 - corruption
 
If such a system could be achieved, it is very likely that it would incredibly low levels of management cost (taxes), wastes (funds ineptly allocated, but with good intentions), and corruption (funds intentionally allocated with bad intentions) relative to the current systems.

Furthermore, recent advances in cryptocurrency and smart contracts make it so that the transfer and allocation of public funds could largely be executed in a way that was transparent and automatic. This capability has never before existed in human history.
